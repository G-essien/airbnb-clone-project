# Overview of Airbnb project 
The Airbnb Clone project is a web application that is intended to replicate a booking and management system that was inspired by Airbnb. It is equipped with a contemporary and responsive user interface that was created using Tailwind CSS and React to guarantee a user-friendly experience. Property listings, detailed property views, a streamlined booking system, and a robust search feature are among the key functionalities. The search feature allows users to filter properties based on criteria such as location, pricing, and availability. The project is dedicated to the creation of a user-friendly, dynamic, and clean design that demonstrates the practical implementations of front-end development technologies.
